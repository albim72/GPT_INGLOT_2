The Application of Artificial Intelligence Algorithms in E-Learning: Personalization and Automation of Educational Processes
Marcin Albiniak
Introduction

Contemporary education is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by the rapid advancement of digital technologies that increasingly shape modern instructional models. One of the most prominent manifestations of this transformation is the development of e-learning, defined as remote education facilitated by internet-based platforms. E-learning not only provides ubiquitous access to knowledge regardless of time and place but also addresses the growing societal demand for flexibility, individualization, and scalability in educational processes. In an era of globalization and the rapid expansion of knowledge-based economies, online education is gaining strategic importance across formal education systems, professional training, and lifelong learning sectors (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019 (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019); Bond et al., 2018 (Bond et al., 2018)).

Parallel to the expansion of e-learning, the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed accelerated development, with its algorithms being increasingly integrated across various domains of social and economic life. Within the educational sphere, AI opens new perspectives for enhancing the learning process by automating many tasks traditionally performed by instructors, such as assessment, progress monitoring, or content recommendation (Chen et al., 2020 (Chen et al., 2020); Holmes et al., 2019 (Holmes et al., 2019)). Furthermore, AI introduces a unique potential for the personalization of instruction in e-learning environments by dynamically adjusting the pace, scope, and format of educational content to the individual needs, preferences, and learning styles of each learner (Pérez-Marín, 2021 (Pérez-Marín, 2021)).
However, the application of AI in e-learning extends far beyond the simple support of didactic processes. AI is becoming the foundation of a new generation of educational systems capable of not only dynamically analyzing user learning data but also predicting potential difficulties, proposing personalized learning pathways, and adapting instructional methods in real time (Luckin et al., 2016 (Luckin et al., 2016); Griffiths et al., 2022 (Griffiths et al., 2022)). Examples of such applications include intelligent recommendation systems, educational chatbots, competency gap detection tools, and automated test generators, all of which are increasingly integrated into modern e-learning platforms (Winkler & Söllner, 2018 (Winkler & Söllner, 2018); Roll & Wylie, 2016 (Roll & Wylie, 2016)).
The purpose of this chapter is to examine how AI algorithms contribute to two key aspects of e-learning development: the personalization and automation of educational processes. Specifically, the chapter explores the role of AI in tailoring instructional content and delivery to the individual learner and in automating tasks that traditionally required significant involvement from teachers and mentors. Particular attention is devoted to learning analytics mechanisms, adaptive systems, and the challenges and limitations associated with AI implementation in digital learning environments. This analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of the potential and future directions of AI technologies in the context of digital
